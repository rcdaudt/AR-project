For the 400*400 small map, an example in terminal:

$ roslaunch ar_project gazebo.launch
$ roslaunch ar_project driver.launch x:=200 y:=350

Note: coordinates are given in image pixels.

When the robot reaches the goal, you can run driver.launch with different coordinates without turning gazebo and rviz off.

e.g.
$ roslaunch ar_project driver.launch x:=200 y:=200
